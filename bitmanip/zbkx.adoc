=== Zbkx: Crossbar permutations

[NOTE,caption=Frozen]
====
The Zbkx extension is frozen.

These instructions implement a "lookup table" for 4 and 8 bit elements
inside the general purpose registers.
_rs1_ is used as a vector of N-bit words, and _rs2_ as a vector of N-bit
indices into _rs1_.
Elements in _rs1_ are replaced by the indexed element in _rs2_, or zero
if the index into _rs2_ is out of bounds.

These instructions are useful for expressing N-bit to N-bit boolean
operations, and implementing cryptographic code with secret
dependent memory accesses (particularly SBoxes) such that the execution
latency does not depend on the (secret) data being operated on.
